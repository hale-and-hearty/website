<p>You agree to not use the Web Properties to: (i) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any User Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, bullying, tortious, false, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit, libelous, invasive of another&rsquo;s privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable; (ii) harm minors in any way; (iii) impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, an official, an employee of Hale and Hearty; (iv) falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity; (v) forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any User Content transmitted through the Web Properties; (vi) upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any User Content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary, and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of an employment relationship or under a nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement); (vii) upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any User Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other proprietary rights of any party, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from the rightful owner to post the material and to grant Hale and Hearty and other users of the Web Properties all of the license rights granted herein; (viii) upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, spam, phishing schemes, pyramid schemes, or any other form of solicitation; (ix) upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment; (x) interfere with or disrupt the Web Properties or any of the servers or networks connected to the Web Properties, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of networks connected to the Web Properties; (xi) intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law; (xii) stalk or otherwise harass another; or (xiii) collect or store personal data about other users.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that, in addition to the other uses set forth in these Terms, Hale and Hearty may preserve User Content and may also disclose User Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (aa) comply with legal process; (bb) enforce these Terms; (cc) respond to claims that any User Content violates the rights of any third parties; or (dd) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Hale and Hearty, its users, and/or the public. You further acknowledge and agree that each person that has access to your User Content may have less restrictions on his or her use of your User Content, and that you submit your User Content with the understanding that any claim you have with respect to such use by others shall be between you and such other person, and shall not include Hale and Hearty.</p>
<p>Hale and Hearty does not endorse any User Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Hale and Hearty expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. Hale and Hearty does not knowingly permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Web Properties, and Hale and Hearty will remove all Content and User Content if properly notified that such Content or User Content infringes or may infringe on another&rsquo;s intellectual property rights. Hale and Hearty reserves the right to remove Content and User Content without prior notice. Without limiting Hale and Hearty&rsquo;s right to cause the termination of a User Account for any or no reason, Hale and Hearty will also cause the termination of a User Account if he or she is determined to be a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a user of the Web Properties who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had User Content removed from the Web Properties more than twice. Hale and Hearty also reserves the right to decide whether User Content is appropriate and complies with these Terms for violations other than violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, obscene or defamatory material. Hale and Hearty may remove such User Content and/or cause the termination of a User Account for uploading such material in violation of these Terms at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that Hale and Hearty may disclose your identity in connection with any claim of an intellectual property violation.</p>

<li><strong>COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS. </strong>Hale and Hearty owns, protects and enforces copyright and other rights in its own intellectual property, and respects the intellectual property rights of others. Materials may be made available on or through the Web Properties by third parties not within the control of Hale and Hearty. It is our policy not to permit materials known by us to be infringing to remain on or available through the Web Properties. Please notify us promptly if you believe that any materials on or available through the Web Properties infringe on your intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of anyone else. Once we receive proper notice of claimed infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the &ldquo;<u>DMCA</u>&rdquo;), Hale and Hearty will respond promptly to remove the material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying party and the alleged infringer who provided the content at issue. When notifying Hale and Hearty of potential infringement, you must include the following:</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works, then a representative list of such works on the Web Properties;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>identification of the supposedly infringing material that is to be removed;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>information reasonably sufficient to permit Hale and Hearty to locate the material on the Web Properties;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>contact information reasonably sufficient to permit Hale and Hearty to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, or email address;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material is in fact infringing and/or not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a statement that, under penalty of perjury, the information in the notification is accurate and where relevant that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; and</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the signature, physical or electronic, of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on his or her behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification. To file a counter notification with us, please provide the DMCA Agent a written communication containing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>identification of the supposedly infringing material that is to be removed;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a statement that, under penalty of perjury, you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your postal address is located, and that you will accept service of process from the party who submitted the infringement notification or his, her, or its principal or agent; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the signature, physical or electronic, of you or a person authorized to act on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hale and Hearty will promptly provide the party that provided the notice of claimed infringement with a copy of the counter notification, and inform the complaining party that we restore the removed or disabled content in ten (10) business days. If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten (10) business days after we provide notice of the counter-notification, we will restore the removed or disabled materials. Until that time, your materials will remain removed or disabled.</p>
<p>Notice of alleged infringement must be sent by electronic mail to the Hale and Hearty Copyright Agent at <a href="mailto:info@haleandhearty.com">info@haleandhearty.com</a> or by certified mail and marked &ldquo;Copyright Infringement&rdquo; to Hale and Hearty Soups LLC, 75 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY 10011 Attn: DMCA AGENT</p>
<p>Before filing such a notification, make a careful determination as to whether or not the use of the material at issue is or may be protected by the &ldquo;fair use&rdquo; doctrine. You could potentially be held liable for costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use. If you are unsure whether there is infringement, it may be advisable to seek legal counsel.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>TERMINATION OF SERVICE. </strong>We may terminate your account or right to access secured portions of the Web Properties at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms and/or is harmful to other users of the Web Properties, to Hale and Hearty, to its partners, to the contributors, to the business of our Internet service provider, or to other information providers. If you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the Content and/or the User Content pursuant to Section 2 (Web Properties Use and Content) automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of any portion of the Content or the User Content.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="13">
<li><strong>ADDITIONAL REMEDIES. You acknowledge that your </strong>conduct that is inconsistent with the provisions of these Terms may cause Hale and Hearty irreparable damage for which remedies other than monetary relief may be inadequate.&nbsp; In such instances, you agree that Hale and Hearty may seek injunctive or other equitable relief seeking to restrain such conduct without the necessity of proving actual harm or posting a bond.</li>
</ol>
